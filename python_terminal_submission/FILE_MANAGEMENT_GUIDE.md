# Enhanced File Management in Web Terminal

## Overview
Your Streamlit web terminal now has comprehensive file and directory management capabilities with both command-line and natural language interfaces.

## New Features Added

### 1. Directory Management
- **`rmdir <directory>`** - Remove empty directories
- **`rmdir -r <directory>`** - Force remove directories and all contents
- Enhanced error handling for directory operations

### 2. File Content Management
- **`echo <text> > <file>`** - Write text content to files
- **`edit <file> [content]`** - Create or edit files with optional content
- Improved file creation with proper encoding

### 3. Enhanced Natural Language Processing
The AI now understands more complex commands:

#### File Creation:
- "create a file called test.py"
- "make a python file named script.py" 
- "create a text file hello.txt"

#### File Deletion:
- "delete the file named old.txt"
- "remove test.py"
- "delete old.txt"

#### Directory Operations:
- "make a folder named project"
- "create a directory called data"
- "remove the directory temp"
- "delete the folder named old_stuff"

#### File Content Writing:
- "write hello world to greeting.txt"
- "write some text to notes.txt"

### 4. Improved Web Interface

#### Sidebar File Manager:
- **Quick Create File**: Input field + button for instant file creation
- **Quick Create Directory**: Input field + button for instant directory creation
- **Natural Language Examples**: Clickable buttons with common commands

#### Enhanced Terminal Output:
- Better formatting for different message types (success, error, info)
- Color-coded responses for better user experience
- Cleaner command history display

## Command Reference

### Basic Commands:
```bash
ls              # List files and directories
mkdir <name>    # Create directory
rmdir <name>    # Remove empty directory
rmdir -r <name> # Force remove directory and contents
touch <file>    # Create empty file
rm <file>       # Remove file
cat <file>      # Display file contents
echo <text> > <file>  # Write text to file
edit <file> [content] # Create/edit file
count           # Count files and directories
pwd             # Show current directory
```

### Natural Language Examples:
```
create a file called script.py
make a folder named documents
write "Hello World" to greeting.txt
delete the file old.txt
remove the directory temp
how many files are here
show me the files
```

## Web-Specific Features

### Session Isolation:
- Each web session gets its own temporary directory
- Files created are isolated per user session
- Automatic cleanup when session ends

### Security:
- Sandboxed file operations within session directory
- No access to system files outside session
- Safe command execution with restricted system access

### User Experience:
- Real-time command execution
- Interactive sidebar with quick actions
- Comprehensive help system
- AI-powered natural language understanding

## Usage Tips

1. **Use the sidebar** for quick file/directory creation
2. **Try natural language** - the AI understands conversational commands
3. **Check the help** command for a full list of available operations
4. **Use `ls` frequently** to see your current files and directories
5. **Try `count`** to get a quick overview of your workspace

## Technical Implementation

The enhanced file management system includes:
- Improved fallback pattern matching for natural language
- Better command routing and error handling
- Enhanced file system operations with proper validation
- Web-optimized UI components for file management
- Session state management for persistent file operations

All file operations are performed within a temporary directory that's unique to each web session, ensuring security and isolation while providing full functionality for learning and experimentation.
